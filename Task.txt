Inheritance mechanism and abstract classes

Create an abstract Shape class with the abstract draw () method.
Make the Point class with the x and y properties (both public) inheriting the Shape class.
Try to create an object of class Point. Analyze the resulting error.
Implement the draw () method in the Point class, displaying the line in it: “We draw a point with coordinates (x, y)”. Of course, instead of x and y there should be specific values.
Call the draw () method on the object of the class Point and make sure that everything works correctly.
